It was a wiring competition where circuit lay out and condition to be obtained are given to the participant and the evaluation was strictly based on output, time taken for work, quality of work etc. 
This highlights the interest of students to participate in more events and also a sign of perfect utilisation of ISTE’s opportunities. We are glad that we could be a platform for them and we congratulate the winners and also those who took part in Sangrah18  from ISTE RIT chapter. We wish we could achieve more.&lt;/p&gt;
